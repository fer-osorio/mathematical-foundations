## Your Project: "Cryptography Showcase with Security-Focused Architecture"

A portfolio website that:
1. **Showcases your GitHub projects** with descriptions and links
2. **Includes interactive cryptographic demonstrations** (built with JavaScript)
3. **Implements security best practices** throughout (which you'll learn and understand)
4. **Serves as a case study** for how cryptography is deployed in web contexts

Over 7 hours weekly, this is very achievable in 8-10 weeks.

## Learning Path (7 hours/week breakdown)

**Weeks 1-2 (Foundations):**
- 3-4 hours: HTML fundamentals + semantic markup
- 2-3 hours: CSS basics (layout, styling, responsiveness)
- Build: A static portfolio page with your projects listed

**Weeks 3-4 (Interactivity):**
- 3-4 hours: JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, event handling)
- 2-3 hours: Client-side form handling and basic validation
- Build: Add a "Contact" form, navigation, interactive menus

**Weeks 5-6 (Web Security Intro):**
- 2-3 hours: **HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and certificate pinning**
- 2-3 hours: **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF, Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- 1-2 hours: Secure coding practices for JavaScript
- Build: Implement security headers, sanitize inputs

**Weeks 7-8 (Cryptography Implementation):**
- 2-3 hours: **Cryptographic libraries for JavaScript** (TweetNaCl.js, libsodium.js)
- 2-3 hours: Building your first interactive demo (e.g., RSA key generation and encryption visualization)
- 1-2 hours: Secure random number generation in browsers, dealing with limitations
- Build: First interactive cryptographic tool

**Weeks 9-10 (Advanced & Polish):**
- 3-4 hours: More interactive demos (hash functions, symmetric encryption visualization)
- 2-3 hours: Performance optimization, security testing, final hardening
- Build: Complete portfolio with 2-3 working cryptographic tools

## Key Security Topics You'll Learn (Mapped to Your Cryptography Background)

This is where your expertise becomes essential. You'll learn:

1. **TLS/SSL Protocol** - Understanding how your cryptographic knowledge (symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hash functions) work together in the real world
2. **Web Cryptography API** - Browser-native cryptographic functions and their limitations
3. **JavaScript Cryptographic Libraries** - How cryptographic primitives are implemented in JavaScript (and why this differs from C/C++)
4. **Key Management in Browsers** - Why you can't securely store keys client-side (a crucial security lesson)
5. **Secure Communication Patterns** - How to design secure client-server interactions
6. **Common Web Vulnerabilities** - How cryptographic mistakes lead to real exploits (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF and how crypto mitigates them)
